- Implementing a WebApi application Tool to write in Reverse Polish Notation RPN: a post-fixed notation which allows to write mathematical expression without parenthesis.
- The business logic rules must be respected as explained in the PDF file
- Some improvements could be done to take a whole expression as parameter and do operations on it
- This expression which is string must be checked before performing actions on it
- Once checked, this expression must be converted to post-fixed representation.
Example : ( 5 + 2 ) * 3 => 5 2 + 3 *
- Once converted, the user can use the same endpoints already implemented to evaluate that expression
- you can use this URL to focus on these post-fixed expressions : https://scanftree.com/Data_Structure/prefix-postfix-infix-online-converter
